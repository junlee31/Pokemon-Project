# Pokemon-Project

In this project, I extracted Pokemon Generation 4 statistics off of https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/stats/gen4#. 
I was then able to compare which Pokemon typing had the sheer advantage in what area of stat (Hp, Atk, Def, Sp. Atk, SP. Def, and Speed.)
Using the data I analyzed, I created a series of multiple bar graphs to illustrate the data.
